It was, perhaps, the coldest day of winter, but the prospect of Warm Winter Music induced a contingent of Tuesday Musicale members to brave the adverse weather and attend the organization’s January 16 concert at the Piano Place in Troy.

Pianists Mary Levack Quick and Yuki Mack began the music with the first and third movements of Mozart’s Piano Concerto #20 in D Minor K. 466, with Yuki playing the orchestral reduction. The concerto begins in a pensive and introspective mood, but there is a joyousness that is continually breaking through, and the concerto ends in a mood of exuberance. These dueling moods were well expressed by the two pianists.

The next piece was Mozart’s Piano and Violin Sonata in B-flat major, K. 318, played by pianist Marina Stojanovska and violinist Kypros Markou. This piece is billed as a “Piano and Violin” sonata rather than, as is the normal practice, naming such duos “Violin and Piano.” As one heard the performance, it became clear why that was the case. A sparkling piano line for the most part predominates, with the violin playing more of a supporting role. An exception is the beautifully second movement: “Andantino sostenuto e cantabile,” in which Mozart features the violin with equally beautiful melodic lines. What a treat this was for us all!

And then another Mozart, his Concerto in A Major, K. 488. It was brought to us by Kathy Ranus and Hiroko Ohtani. Owing to time constraints, they began their performance with the second movement, “Adagio,” with Kathy playing the solo part and Hiroko playing the orchestral reduction. This is a soulful and sublime piece of writing, into which Kathy and Hiroko entered most effectively. The last movement, “Allegro assai” is bright and glorious, with the two pianists, this time with Hiroko playing the solo part, gave full expression. A very fine presentation of one of Mozart’s best!

By the way, Tuesday Musicale will be presenting this concerto again on May 30 when the brilliant young pianist and former Tuesday Musicale Student Leaguer Gregory Turner will be performing it at St. James Catholic Church in Novi with the Tuesday Musicale Chamber Orchestra.

The final piece on the program was Rachmaninoff’s Piano Sonata in B-Flat Minor, opus 36. This was performed for us by Maria Meirelles.

This piece has a fascinating history. As originally written, Rachmaninoff was dissatisfied with it and wrote a revised version, shortening some sections and simplifying some technically difficult passages. Drawing from both versions, the legendary pianist Vladimir Horowitz assessed the situation and came up with a third version which he performed. Rachmaninoff heard this version and told Horowitz that it was his favorite. It was this version that we heard as Maria Meirelles performed for us. Those present, gave Maria a well-earned standing ovation.

The audience members left the concert gratified that they had chosen to confront the elements to hear these wonderful compositions. Of particular interest is a performance of Mozart’s Horn Concerto #2 Catholic Church in Novi with the Tuesday Musicale Chamber Orchestra.
